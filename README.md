# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
## Step 1:
Assign the coordinates of the first point (x1, y1) and the second point (x2, y2).

## Step 2:
Calculate the difference between the x-coordinates of the two points and between y coordinates of two points

## Step 3:
Substitute the values in the distance formula formula

## Step 4:
The distance variable now contains the calculated distance between the two points.

## Step 5:
print it
### PROGRAM:
